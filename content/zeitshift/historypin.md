Thank you for choosing to contribute to Zeit.shift! These guidelines will walk you through the Historypin activity. The activity consists in tagging advertisements published in Tyrolean newspapers 100 years ago.

<!--🗝️**Your contribution is key to making this collection of Tyrolean textual heritage more searchable, usable and discoverable for everyone!**-->

<strong>This activity is designed for desktop computers.</strong>

For questions about the activity or comments about these guidelines, please contact the Zeit.shift team at: <strong>zeitshift@eurac.edu</strong>.


## 1. Accessing the collection

Open an internet browser (we recommend you use [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/)) and navigate to: <a href="https://www.historypin.org/en/zeit-shift" target="_blank">https://www.historypin.org/en/zeit-shift</a>

<img src="/images/home.png" alt="Historypin" width="100%"/><p style="font-size: 10pt"><em>Landing page of the Zeit.shift collection in Historypin</em>.</p>

Click on the white arrow or scroll down the landing page to view the contents of the collection. This gallery page lists all adverts and subcollections within Zeit.shift. Each subcollection corresponds to a different newspaper.

NB: In Historypin, collection items are known as "pins". In the case of Zeit.shift, pins are adverts. In these guidelines, we will refer to collection items as "adverts" or "pins".

<!--## 2. Picking the correct pins in the Collection

The search bar below the project banner allows you to search contents by tags and keywords, or to filter them by the presence of comments.


<img src="/images/search2.png" alt="Historypin" width="100%"/><p style="font-size: 10pt"><em>If clicked, the "zu lokalisieren" and "zu taggen" tags allow you to display only those adverts that still need to be worked on. If clicked, these tags will automatically appear in the search bar</em>.</p>


<img src="/images/search3.png" alt="Historypin" width="100%"/><p style="font-size: 10pt"><em>If clicked, the "zu lokalisieren" tag on the left will automatically appear in the search bar on the right of the screen</em>.</p>

To deselect the "zu lokalisieren" and "zu taggen" tags, click on the corresponding 🗙 icon in the search bar.

<img src="/images/search4.png" alt="Historypin" width="100%"/><p style="font-size: 10pt"><em>To deselect a tag, click on the corresponding 🗙 icon in the search bar.</em>.</p>


<img src="/images/search.png" alt="Historypin" width="100%"/><p style="font-size: 10pt"><em>To search for adverts that have comments, type "has" in the search box and click on the option provided</em>.</p>

Additionally, you can use the drop-down menu next to the search bar to sort contents chronologically or alphabetically.

## 2. Contributing to the collection
To begin the activity, click on the subcollection or newspaper you wish to work on. The landing page of the subcollection looks exactly like that of the main Zeit.shift collection.

<img src="/images/tigbo.png" alt="Historypin" width="100%"/><p style="font-size: 10pt"><em>Landing page of the</em> Tiroler Grenzbote <em>subcollection within Zeit.shift</em>.</p>


Next, click on the "zu lokalisieren" and "zu taggen" tags to display adverts that need to be worked on.

<img src="/images/search2.png" alt="Historypin" width="100%"/><p style="font-size: 10pt"><em>If clicked, the "zu lokalisieren" and "zu taggen" tags allow you to display only those adverts that still need to be worked on. If clicked, these tags will automatically appear in the search bar</em>.</p>


With the "zu lokalisieren" and/or "zu taggen" tags selected, click on an advert of your choice to start working on it.


### 2.1. Suggest a better location
To suggest a better location for the advert, click on the _Suggest a better location_ link provided in the _Location_ box. Doing so will open up a window in which you will be asked to add the suggested location. You can provide rough or precise locations using the search bar and/or the map view. For added precision, you can drag-and-drop the large pink pin to your desired location. Should you wish to enlarge the map, click on the white enlarge icon in the top right corner. Click it again to return to the original size. To save your suggestion, add a comment, click on the _Save_ button and close the window using the pink 🗙 icon in the top right corner.

<img src="/images/location.png" alt="Suggest location" width="100%"/><p style="font-size: 10pt">Suggest a better location <em>window. The</em> Comment <em>field is mandatory!</em></p>


If the advert does not contain an address, add a "ohne ort" tag using the _Add a tag_ option provided in the right sidebar (see next section).


### 2.2. Tags
The _Tags_ section allows you to categorise an advert. Tags in Zeit.shift should be lowercase, can be in English, German or Italian and are very useful as they help Zeit.shift and Historypin users find specific items more easily. We ask that you add the following tags:

- "ohne ort", if the advert does not contain an address;
- "unleserlich", if the advert is not clearly legible (e.g. the ink is faded or the image is grainy);
- "duplikat", if the advert is a duplicate of another advert;
- "review", if there are other problems with the advert you wish to report (e.g. a part of it is missing);
- at least three semantic tags that best describe the advert, including person names, objects, festivities, etc. (e.g. "adolf titze", "shoes", "christmas").


To add a semantic tag, type the name in the _Tag name_ field. As you type the name, a drop-down list will appear with suggestions based on what other Historypin users have added. If your tag already exists in the list of suggestions, select it and click on the _Add a tag_ button. If your tag does not appear in the list of suggestions, click on the first entry in the list and click on the _Add a tag_ button again. New tags should appear alongside the advert's existing tags below the location map.

NB: umlauts are not rendered in Historypin, so make sure to spell out the word (e.g. NOT "mühle" BUT "muehle").

### 2.3. Optional

Additionally, in the sidebar to the right of the screen, the _Share_ button provides you with options to share the advert via social media or to embed it in a website.


<img src="/images/share.png" alt="Historypin" width="100%"/><p style="font-size: 10pt"><em>Click on the</em> Share <em>button in the right sidebar to share the advert on social media or a website</em>.</p>

Below the _Share_ button, you will see the _Favourite_ ♡ button. This button allows you to mark the advert as a favourite item. When you favourite an item, the ♡ button turns orange; to unfavourite it, simply reclick on the ♡ button until this becomes pink again. All favourited items can be viewed in your profile under the _Favourites_ section.


<img src="/images/favourite.png" alt="Historypin" width="100%"/><p style="font-size: 10pt"><em>Click on the ♡ button in the right sidebar to save an advert to your list of favourites</em>.</p>



<img src="/images/profile.png" alt="Historypin" width="100%"/><p style="font-size: 10pt"><em>Click on the profile button in the top right corner of the screen to access your Historypin profile and list of favourited pins.</em>.</p>

<img src="/images/favourite2.png" alt="Historypin" width="100%"/><p style="font-size: 10pt"><em>You can view your list of favourites under your Historypin profile, in the </em>Favourites <em>section</em>.</p>



Below the _Favourite_ button you will see the _Repin_ button. This button allows you to make a copy of the pin in another Historypin collection. When you click on _Repin_, you will be asked whether you want to save a copy of the pin in an existing collection to which you have contribution access or in a new collection of your own creation.


<img src="/images/repin.png" alt="Historypin" width="100%"/><p style="font-size: 10pt"><em>The</em> Repin <em>button in the right sidebar allows you to add the advert to another collection to which you have access, including your own.</em></p>
