Thank you for choosing to contribute to Zeit.shift! These guidelines will walk you through the Historypin activity. The activity consists in tagging advertisements published in Tyrolean newspapers 100 years ago.

<!--üóùÔ∏è**Your contribution is key to making this collection of Tyrolean textual heritage more searchable, usable and discoverable for everyone!**-->

For questions about the activity or comments about these guidelines, please contact the Zeit.shift team at: all4ling@eurac.edu.

## Instructions

### 1. Accessing the collection

Open an internet browser (we recommend you use [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/)) and navigate to: [https://www.historypin.org/en/zeit-shift](https://www.historypin.org/en/zeit-shift)

<img src="/images/chrome_home.png" alt="Historypin" width="100%"/><p style="font-size: 10pt"><em>Zeit.shift landing page in Historypin</em>.</p>

Click on the white arrow or scroll down the landing page to view the contents of the collection. This gallery page lists all adverts and subcollections within Zeit.shift. Each subcollection corresponds to a different newspaper.

NB: In Historypin, collection items are known as "pins". In the case of Zeit.shift, pins are adverts. In these guidelines, we will refer to collection items as "adverts" or "pins".


### 2. About the collection

The _About the Collection_ card provides a summary description of the project, and a link to these guidelines. The description can also be accessed by clicking on the pink information button on the sidebar to the right of the screen. To close this information pane, click on the pink ‚ùå icon visible in the top right corner of the window.

### 3. Searching the collections

The search bar below the project banner allows you to search contents by tags and keywords, or to filter them by the presence of comments.

Additionally, you can use the drop-down menu next to the search bar to sort contents chronologically or alphabetically.

### 4. Contributing to the collection
To begin the activity, click on the subcollection or newspaper you wish to work on. The landing page of the subcollection looks exactly like that of the main Zeit.shift collection.

Click on an advert of your choice to start working on it. The advert window contains different blocks of information:

- _Title_: the title of the advert.
- _Description_: a short description of the advert with a link to these guidelines.
- _Comments_: a space for you to transcribe the advert and/or add any other interesting information about it. To add a comment or suggestions to an advert, you must first login with your Historypin account (accounts are free).
- _Date_: date of the advert with an option to provide a better one, if known.
- _Location_: location of the advert with an option to provide a better one, if known.
- _Tags_: a list of tags describing the advert with an option to add more tags that best describe it. Clicking on a tag will open a different Historypin window with a list of all collection items matching that tag.
- _Metadata_: information about the advert, including a link to the digitised newspaper from which it is taken and a permanent link should you wish to cite it; all adverts are published under a Creative Commons By 3.0 Licence which means you are allowed to reuse this advert as you please provided that you credit the source (Eurac Research).
- _Report a pin:_ should you see any inappropriate comment, click on this link to report the problem. NB: These reports are sent to Historypin, not to Eurac Research.

Additionally, in the sidebar to the right of the screen, the _Share_ button provides you with options to share the advert via social media or to embed it in a website.

SCREENSHOT OF SHARING WINDOW

Below the _Share_ button, you will see the _Favourite_ button. This button allows you to mark the advert as a favourite item. When you favourite an item, the heart icon turns orange; to unfavourite it, simply reclick on the heart button until this becomes pink again. All favourited items can be viewed in your profile under the _Favourites_ section.

SCREENSHOT OF FAVOURITES IN PROFILE



Below the _Favourite_ button you will see the _Repin_ button. This button allows you to make a copy of the pin in another Historypin collection. When you click on _Repin_, you will be asked whether you want to save a copy of the pin in an existing collection to which you have contribution access or in a new collection of your own creation.

**To add a comment or suggestions to an advert, you must first login with your Historypin account. Accounts are free!**

#### 4.1. Suggest a better date

To suggest a better date for the advert, click on the _Suggest a better date_ link provided in the _Date_ box. Doing so will open up a window in which you will be asked to add the suggested date according to a particular format and to comment your suggestion. You cannot save a suggestion without commenting it. Once you're done, click on the pink _Save_ button and close the window using the close icon in the top right corner.

#### 4.2. Suggest a better location
To suggest a better location for the advert, click on the _Suggest a better location_ link provided in the _Location_ box. Doing so will open up a window in which you will be asked to add the suggested location. You can provide rough or precise locations using the search bar and/or the map view. For added precision, you can drag-and-drop the large pink pin to your desired location. Should you wish to enlarge the map, click on the white icon in the top right corner. Click it again to return to the original size. To save your suggestion, add a comment, click on the _Save_ button and close the window using the pink icon in the top right corner.

#### 4.3. Tags
The _Tags_ section allows you to categorise an advert. Tags in Zeit.shift can be added in English, German or Italian and are very useful as they allow all Zeit.shift and Historypin users find specific items more easily. To add a tag, type the name in the _Tag name_ field. As you type the name, a drop-down list will appear with suggestions based on what other Historypin users have added. If your tag already exists in the list of suggestions, select it and click on the _Add a tag_ button. If your tag does not appear in the list of suggestions, click on the first entry in the list and click on the _Add a tag_ button again. New tags should appear alongside the advert's existing tags below the location map.

If you're not happy with your tag, you can delete it by clicking on the ‚ùå icon provided.

#### 7. FAQ

**Why does the number of pins on the map keep changing?**<br />
This is a known Historypin bug. Refreshing the page will restore the correct number of pins.

**Why are my comments and tags disappearing?**<br />
This is a known Historypin caching issue. Your comments and tags are being recorded but take 15-20 minutes to appear online.
