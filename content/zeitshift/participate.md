## How can I contribute?

We're developing **interactive applications** designed to help you explore this wonderful body of textual heritage as you contribute data!

**We need your help with two tasks**:
1. üìç Locate and/or tag advertisements
2. ‚å®Ô∏è Transcribe individual words by playing a game

**Your help will make the newspapers more usable for both humans and machines!**
- The processed text will be made available on the websites of the Friedrich Te√ümann and Innsbruck University libraries for users to search, browse and enjoy.
- The processed text will be used by Eurac Research to train algorithms to better recognise Fraktur script and classify words (place names, person names, temporal expressions, etc.).


### üìç Historypin

In this activity, citizens locate and tag historical advertisements published in the newspapers in order to reconstruct the commercial landscape of early 20th century Tyrol. Many shops from those times still exist today!

This activity makes use of an existing third-party platform, [Historypin](https://www.historypin.org/en/).

**You will need**:

- Basic knowledge of German and Fraktur script
- A free <a href="https://www.historypin.org" target="_blank">Historypin</a> account
- A desktop computer (activity not designed for mobile devices)
- To add [specific tags]({{< relref path="zeitshift/historypin#32-tags">}}) and/or location information to the newspaper adverts (the choice is free!)

### ‚å®Ô∏è Who killed √ñtzi?

<img src="/images/wko.png" alt="Game preview" width="100%"/><p style="font-size: 10pt" xmlns:cc="http://creativecommons.org/ns#" ><em>'Who killed √ñtzi?</em> game. This image is licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/?ref=chooser-v1" target="_blank" rel="license noopener noreferrer" style="display:inline-block;">CC BY 3.0<img style="height:15px!important;margin-left:3px;vertical-align:text-bottom;" src="https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/cc.svg?ref=chooser-v1"><img style="height:15px!important;margin-left:3px;vertical-align:text-bottom;" src="https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/by.svg?ref=chooser-v1"></a></p>

In this custom game, inspired by [Typespeed](http://typespeed.sourceforge.net/), arrows carrying words in Fraktur script fly from the left to the right of the screen in the direction of [√ñtzi the Iceman](https://www.iceman.it/en/the-iceman/). These words are people names extracted from the Tyrolean newspapers. The goal of the game is simple: you must type the names as fast as possible before they reach and kill √ñtzi! The more words you type the longer √ñtzi lives and the more points you collect. When √ñtzi dies, you are shown the original newspaper article from which the killing name (the killer!) was taken, allowing you to explore its context.

**Requirements**:

- sufficient knowledge of German and Fraktur

No sign-up or registration required!
