**Zeit.shift** is a cooperation between the [Dr. Friedrich Te√ümann Library](https://www.tessmann.it/en/home.html) (Bolzano, Italy), the [Universit√§ts- und Landesbibliothek Tirol](https://www.uibk.ac.at/ulb/) (Innsbruck, Austria) and [Eurac Research](https://www.eurac.edu/) (Bolzano, Italy) funded by the [European Regional Development Fund and Interreg V-A Italia - Austria 2014-2020](https://www.interreg.net/en/default.asp), which seeks to preserve, develop and communicate the cultural and textual heritage of the historical region of Tyrol.

The project focuses on **historical newspapers written in German** and mostly [Fraktur script](https://web.library.yale.edu/cataloging/music/fraktur), which are currently scattered across Tyrol and are only partially digitised. **The goal of the project is twofold**:
1. digitise some 500,000 pages of Tyrolean papers published between 1850 and 1950 and gather them in a single, freely accessible web platform;
2. promote participatory culture research by inviting citizens to actively curate, explore and engage with the data to accelerate research and create new knowledge.

<!--The involvement of citizens responds to the principles of the [European Citizen Science Association](https://ecsa.citizen-science.net/), which identify high-quality citizen science projects ([Robinson et al. 2018, p. 29](https://discovery.dundee.ac.uk/ws/files/29458369/Citizen_Science_min.pdf)).-->

Given the large number of newspapers (approx. 500,000 pages), **the more people help curate the data** and spread the word about Zeit.shift, **the more searchable the newspaper corpus becomes and the longer the historical memory of Tyrol will be preserved**.



### Why should you contribute?

**Your contributions to Zeit.shift will help**:

- accelerate research progress
- make text more searchable and usable
- create new knowledge for education and research alike
- make the newspaper collection more discoverable
- preserve the historical memory of Tyrol

**Personal benefits you can expect from your involvement are**:

- increased awareness of Tyrolean history and culture
- increased understanding of research procedures (e.g. digitisation and data quality)
- possibility of influencing changes in project methodology, objectives, development, results or dissemination
- open access to project data, which you can reuse in your own project as you please
- acknowledgement of your contribution in academic publications and on our website <!-- LINK TO COMMUNITY PAGE, WHEN AVAILABLE -->
- self-contained, casual tasks you can do whenever suits you best
- discover new interests, likeminded people and communities

### How can you contribute?

We're developing **interactive applications** designed to help you explore this wonderful body of textual heritage as you contribute data!

**We need your help with two tasks**:
1. üìç Locate and tag advertisements
2. ‚å®Ô∏è Transcribe individual words

**Your help will make the newspapers more usable for both humans and machines!**
- The clean text will be made available on the websites of the Friedrich Te√ümann and Innsbruck University libraries for users to search, browse and enjoy.
- The clean text will be used by Eurac Research to train algorithms to better recognise Fraktur script and classify words (place names, person names, temporal expressions, etc.).

In this activity, citizens locate and tag historical advertisements published in the newspapers in order to reconstruct the commercial landscape of early 20th century Tyrol. Many shops from those times still exist today!

This activity makes use of an existing third-party platform, [Historypin](https://www.historypin.org/en/).

**Requirements**:

- Basic knowledge of German and Fraktur script
- A free Historypin account

In this custom game, inspired by [Typespeed](http://typespeed.sourceforge.net/), arrows carrying words in Fraktur script fly from the left to the right of the screen in the direction of [√ñtzi the Iceman](https://www.iceman.it/en/the-iceman/). These words are people names extracted from the Tyrolean newspapers. The goal of the game is simple: you must type the names as fast as possible before they reach and kill √ñtzi! The more words you type the longer √ñtzi lives and the more points you collect. When √ñtzi dies, you are shown the original newspaper article from which the killing name (the killer!) was taken, allowing you to explore its context.

**Requirements**:

- sufficient knowledge of German and Fraktur
