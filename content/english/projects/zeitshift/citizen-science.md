We need your help with two tasks:

1. Correct [OCR mistakes](https://all4ling.eurac.edu/docs/zeitshift/introduction/#digitisation) (sufficient knowledge of German and Fraktur required)
2. Geotag newspaper content (basic knowledge of German and Fraktur required)
<!--3. Tag and classify words (names of people and places, parts-of-speech, etc.)-->

To make these tasks more engaging, we're developing **games and activities** designed to help you explore this wonderful body of textual heritage as you contribute data! So far, we've developed one game and one activity.

No sign-up or registration required!


## OCR correction

This custom game adapts [Typespeed](http://typespeed.sourceforge.net/). The game comes with different scenarios. In the "Who Killed Ötzi?" scenario shown below, arrows carrying words in Fraktur script fly from the left to the right of the screen in the direction of [Ötzi the Iceman](https://www.iceman.it/en/the-iceman/). These words are people names extracted from the Tyrolean newspapers. The goal of the game is simple: you must type the names as fast as possible before they reach and kill Ötzi! The more words you type the longer Ötzi lives and the more points you collect. When Ötzi dies, you are shown the original newspaper article from which the killing name (the killer!) was taken, allowing you to explore its context.

- <strong>Task type</strong>: microtask
- <strong>Purpose of the game</strong>: correct the OCR of individual words

## Mapping advertisements

In this activity, citizens geotag and, optionally, transcribe historical advertisements published in the newspapers in order to reconstruct the commercial landscape of early 20th century Tyrol. Many shops from those times still exist today!

This activity makes use of an existing third-party platform, [Historypin](https://www.historypin.org/en/).


- <strong>Task type</strong>: micro- and macrotask
- <strong>Purpose of the activity</strong>: geotag ads, correct the OCR of short blocks of text, collect expert knowledge from the public
