**All4Ling** (All for Linguistics) is an initiative of the Institute of Applied Linguistics of Eurac Research devoted to the development of Citizen Science projects and expertise.

As the name suggests, All4Ling focuses on language and linguistics but is becoming increasingly involved in interdisciplinary Digital Humanities research.

Please visit our _Projects_ page for a list of current activities.
