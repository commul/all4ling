**Zeit.shift** is a cross-border cooperation between the Dr. Friedrich Te√ümann Library (Bolzano, Italy), the University and Regional Library of Tyrol (Innsbruck, Austria) and Eurac Research (Bolzano, Italy), which **seeks to preserve, develop and communicate the cultural and textual heritage of the historical region of Tyrol**.

The project focuses on **historical newspapers**, which are currently scattered across Tyrol and are only partially digitised. It will digitise some 500,000 pages of Tyrolean papers published between 1850 and 1950 and gather these **in a single, freely accessible web platform**, **inviting citizens to curate, explore and engage with the data through activities, games and teaching materials**.

**The mutual collaboration between researchers, librarians and citizens** will help improve the functionality of the web platform for users worldwide and serve as an **opportunity for local and foreign communities to learn more about the historical and cultural heritage of Tyrol**.
