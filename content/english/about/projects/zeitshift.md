### Summary

**Zeit.shift** is a cross-border cooperation between the [Dr. Friedrich Te√ümann Library](https://www.tessmann.it/en/home.html) (Bolzano, Italy), the [Universit√§ts- und Landesbibliothek Tirol](https://www.uibk.ac.at/ulb/) (Innsbruck, Austria) and [Eurac Research](https://www.eurac.edu/) (Bolzano, Italy), which **seeks to preserve, develop and communicate the cultural and textual heritage of the historical region of Tyrol**.

The project focuses on **historical newspapers**, which are currently scattered across Tyrol and are only partially digitised. It will digitise some 500,000 pages of Tyrolean papers published between 1850 and 1950 and gather these in a single, freely accessible web platform, **inviting citizens to curate, explore and engage with the data through activities, games and learning materials**.

**The mutual collaboration between researchers, librarians and citizens** will help improve the functionality of the web platform for users worldwide and serve as an **opportunity for local and foreign communities to learn more about** the historical and cultural heritage of **Tyrol**.


### How can citizens contribute?

Zeit.shift develops games and activities to crowdsource data from citizens while guiding them through the materials to explore the history and culture of Tyrol.


### The importance of citizen collaboration

The active participation of citizens is crucial to the success of the project. Given the large number of newspapers (approx. 500,000 pages), the more people help curate the data and spread the word about Zeit.shift, the more searchable the corpus becomes and the longer the historical memory of Tyrol will be preserved.

### Prototype

The prototype games and activities of the Zeit.shift are developed on a small selection of the entire project dataset, illustrated in the table below.

|Year  | Newspaper | N. pages |
|------|-----------|---------:|
| 1918 | Tiroler Land-Zeitung |   408 |
| 1919 | Der Arbeiter         |  252|
| 1920 | Volkszeitung/Deutsche Volkszeitung    | 2692|
| 1921 | Tiroler Wastl        |  364|
| 1922 | Tiroler Wastl        |  156|
| 1923 | Tiroler Grenzbote    |  488|
| 1924 | Der S√ºdtiroler       |   96|
|      |                      |**Total pages**: 4456|


##### Game: Who killed √ñtzi?

This game adapts [Typespeed](http://typespeed.sourceforge.net/). Arrows carrying words in gothic script fly from the left of the screen over to the right in the direction of [√ñtzi the Iceman](https://www.iceman.it/en/the-iceman/). These words are randomly selected people names mentioned in the Tyrolean newspapers. The goal of the game is simple: players must type the words as fast as possible before they reach and kill √ñtzi! The more words are typed the longer √ñtzi lives, the more points the player collects. When √ñtzi dies, players are shown the original newspaper page from which the killing word was taken, allowing them to explore its context.

##### Activity: Ad map

In this activity, citizens geotag and, optionally, transcribe historical advertisements published in the newspapers in order to reconstruct the commercial landscape of 19th and 20th century Tyrol. Many shops from the time still exist today!
