### Summary

**Zeit.shift** is a cross-border cooperation between the [Dr. Friedrich Te√ümann Library](https://www.tessmann.it/en/home.html) (Bolzano, Italy), the [Universit√§ts- und Landesbibliothek Tirol](https://www.uibk.ac.at/ulb/) (Innsbruck, Austria) and [Eurac Research](https://www.eurac.edu/) (Bolzano, Italy), which **seeks to preserve, develop and communicate the cultural and textual heritage of the historical region of Tyrol**.

The project focuses on **historical newspapers**, which are currently scattered across Tyrol and are only partially digitised. It will digitise some 500,000 pages of Tyrolean papers published between 1850 and 1950 and gather these in a single, freely accessible web platform, **inviting citizens to curate, explore and engage with the data through activities, games and learning materials**.

**The mutual collaboration between researchers, librarians and citizens** will help improve the functionality of the web platform for users worldwide and serve as an **opportunity for local and foreign communities to learn more about** the historical and cultural heritage of **Tyrol**.

The active participation of citizens is crucial to the success of the project. Given the large number of newspapers (approx. 500,000 pages), **the more people help curate the data and spread the word** about Zeit.shift, **the more searchable the newspaper corpus becomes and the longer the historical memory of Tyrol will be preserved**.

### Digitisation

Zeit.shift is scanning decaying newspapers and running the scans through Optical Character Recognition (OCR). OCR is the automatic conversion of printed text (e.g. an image of a newspaper page!) into digital format (e.g. a Word document). This process often introduces errors in the digital text, especially when dealing with historical sources: issues such as faded ink, complex fonts or poor quality scans affect the recognition capabilities of the OCR machine. A digital text containing OCR mistakes is known as "noisy" text. The noisier the text, the harder it is to use and search.

Here is an example of a "noisy" conversion of a digitised newspaper in Zeit.shift:

### How can I contribute?

We need your help to do two things:

1. Correct OCR mistakes
2. Tag and classify words (names of people and places, parts-of-speech, etc.)

You don't need to meet any prerequisites. Anyone can contribute!

To make these tasks more engaging, we're developing games and activities designed to help you explore this wonderful collection of newspapers and the heritage of Tyrol as you contribute data! So far, we've developed one game and one activity.


##### Game preview: OCR correction

This game adapts [Typespeed](http://typespeed.sourceforge.net/). The game comes with different scenarios. In the "Who Killed √ñtzi?" scenario shown below, arrows carrying words in Fraktur script fly from the left to the right of the screen in the direction of [√ñtzi the Iceman](https://www.iceman.it/en/the-iceman/). These words are people names extracted from the Tyrolean newspapers. The goal of the game is simple: players must type the names as fast as possible before they reach and kill √ñtzi! The more words are typed the longer √ñtzi lives and the more points the player collects. When √ñtzi dies, players are shown the original newspaper page from which the killing name (the killer!) was taken, allowing them to explore its context.

##### Activity preview: Mapping advertisements

In this activity, citizens geotag and, optionally, transcribe historical advertisements published in the newspapers in order to reconstruct the commercial landscape of 19th and 20th century Tyrol. Many shops from the time still exist today!

<!--#### More to come...

New activities and games will be announced through the All4Ling blog. Ideas and suggestions are always most welcome!-->

<!--
For testing purposes, these games and activities are developed on a small selection of the entire project dataset, .
