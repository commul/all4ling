### Summary

**Zeit.shift** is a cross-border cooperation between the [Dr. Friedrich Te√ümann Library](https://www.tessmann.it/en/home.html) (Bolzano, Italy), the [Universit√§ts- und Landesbibliothek Tirol](https://www.uibk.ac.at/ulb/) (Innsbruck, Austria) and [Eurac Research](https://www.eurac.edu/) (Bolzano, Italy), which **seeks to preserve, develop and communicate the cultural and textual heritage of the historical region of Tyrol**.

The project focuses on **historical newspapers**, which are currently scattered across Tyrol and are only partially digitised. It will digitise some 500,000 pages of Tyrolean papers published between 1850 and 1950 and gather these in a single, freely accessible web platform, **inviting citizens to curate, explore and engage with the data through activities, games and learning materials**.

**The mutual collaboration between researchers, librarians and citizens** will help improve the functionality of the web platform for users worldwide and serve as an **opportunity for local and foreign communities to learn more about** the historical and cultural heritage of **Tyrol**.

### How can citizens contribute?

Zeit.shift is developing a number of games and activities to crowdsource data from citizens while guiding them through the materials to explore the history and culture of Tyrol.

#### Who killed √ñtzi?

This game adapts [Typespeed](http://typespeed.sourceforge.net/). Arrows carrying words in gothic script fly from the left of the screen over to the right in the direction of [√ñtzi the Iceman](https://www.iceman.it/en/the-iceman/). These words are randomly selected people (AND PLACE??) names mentioned in the Tyrolean newspapers. The goal of the game is simple: players must type the words as fast as possible before they reach and kill √ñtzi! The more words are typed the longer √ñtzi lives. When √ñtzi dies, players are shown the original newspaper page from which the killing word was taken, allowing them to explore its context.

#### Add the ad!

In this activity, citizens are shown images of historical advertisements published in the newspapers. The purpose of the activity is to correct mistakes in the transcription of these ads produced by the computer, classify the ads by topic and geotag them on a map in order to reconstruct the commercial landscape of Tyrol. Many shops from the 19th and 20th centuries still exist today! Help us reconstruct the ad map of your hometown or area!


{{<figure src="/images/admap.png" alt="Example advertisement" caption="<em>1932 ad from St Markus Apotheke in Vienna, advertising tablets for tired men to strengthen their nerves! The pharmacy exists to this day.</em>" width="100%" class="border-0">}}


#### More to come...

New activities and games will be announced through the All4Ling blog. Ideas and suggestions are always most welcome!

### The importance of citizen collaboration

The active participation of citizens is crucial to the success of the project. Given the large number of newspapers (approx. 500,000 pages), the more people help curate the data and spread the word about Zeit.shift, the more searchable the corpus becomes and the longer the historical memory of Tyrol will be preserved.
