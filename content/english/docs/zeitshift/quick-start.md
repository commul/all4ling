Zeit.shift invites citizens to actively participate in data curation. The citizen science component of the project focuses on newspaper issues published approximately 100 years ago (1918-1924).
**Anyone can contribute to Zeit.shift, provided they have some knowledge of German and Fraktur script.**

We need your help with two tasks:

1. Correct OCR mistakes (sufficient knowledge of German and Fraktur required)
2. Geotag newspaper content (basic knowledge of German and Fraktur required)
<!--3. Tag and classify words (names of people and places, parts-of-speech, etc.)-->

To make these tasks more engaging, we're developing **games and activities** designed to help you explore this wonderful body of textual heritage as you contribute data! So far, we've developed one game and one activity.

No sign-up or registration required!


## OCR correction

This custom game adapts [Typespeed](http://typespeed.sourceforge.net/). The game comes with different scenarios. In the "Who Killed Ötzi?" scenario shown below, arrows carrying words in Fraktur script fly from the left to the right of the screen in the direction of [Ötzi the Iceman](https://www.iceman.it/en/the-iceman/). These words are people names extracted from the Tyrolean newspapers. The goal of the game is simple: players must type the names as fast as possible before they reach and kill Ötzi! The more words are typed the longer Ötzi lives and the more points the player collects. When Ötzi dies, players are shown the original newspaper article from which the killing name (the killer!) was taken, allowing them to explore its context.

## Mapping advertisements

In this activity, citizens geotag and, optionally, transcribe historical advertisements published in the newspapers in order to reconstruct the commercial landscape of early 20th century Tyrol. Many shops from those times still exist today!

This activity makes use of an existing third-party platform, [Historypin](https://www.historypin.org/en/).
