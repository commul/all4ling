## Summary


**Zeit.shift** is a cross-border cooperation between the [Dr. Friedrich Teßmann Library](https://www.tessmann.it/en/home.html) (Bolzano, Italy), the [Universitäts- und Landesbibliothek Tirol](https://www.uibk.ac.at/ulb/) (Innsbruck, Austria) and [Eurac Research](https://www.eurac.edu/) (Bolzano, Italy), which **seeks to preserve, develop and communicate the cultural and textual heritage of the historical region of Tyrol**.

The project focuses on **historical newspapers written in German and mostly [Fraktur script](https://web.library.yale.edu/cataloging/music/fraktur)**, which are currently scattered across Tyrol and are only partially digitised. It will digitise some 500,000 pages of Tyrolean papers published between 1850 and 1950 and gather these in a single, freely accessible web platform, **inviting citizens to curate, explore and engage with the data through activities, games and learning materials**.

**The mutual collaboration between researchers, librarians and citizens** will help improve the functionality of the web platform for users worldwide and serve as an **opportunity for local and foreign communities to learn more about** the historical and cultural heritage of **Tyrol**.

The active participation of citizens is crucial to the success of the project. Given the large number of newspapers (approx. 500,000 pages), **the more people help curate the data and spread the word** about Zeit.shift, **the more searchable the newspaper corpus becomes and the longer the historical memory of Tyrol will be preserved**.


## The newspapers

The Tyrolean newspapers we are digitising are the following (titles shortened): Innsbrucker Zeitung, Alpenland, Alpenländer Bote, Der Arbeiter, Volksruf, Gardasee-Post, Neueste Zeitung, Neueste Morgenzeitung, Innsbrucker Neueste, Innsbrucker illustrierte neueste Nachrichten, Abendblatt, Innsbrucker Abendblatt, Der Oberländer, Der Südtiroler, Tiroler Bauernzeitung, Tiroler Landbote, Der Landbote, Tiroler Grenzbote, Tiroler Volksblatt, Tiroler Land-Zeitung, Tiroler Gemeindeblatt, Alpenrosen, Oberinntaler Wochenblatt, Neue Inn-Zeitung, Tiroler Post, Die Post, Tiroler Sonntagsbote, Der Tiroler Wastl, Der Widerhall, Tiroler-Vorarlberger Bienen-Zeitung, Tiroler Bienen-Zeitung, Alpenländische Bienenzeitung, Unterinntaler Bote, Haller Wochenblatt, Sterne und Blumen, Volkszeitung Innsbruck, Deutsche Volkszeitung.

## Digitisation

Zeit.shift is digitally scanning the newspapers and running the scans through Optical Character Recognition (OCR). OCR is the automatic conversion of printed text (e.g. an image of a newspaper page!) into digital format (e.g. a Word document). This process often introduces errors in the digital text, especially when dealing with historical sources: issues such as faded ink, complex fonts or poor quality scans affect the recognition capabilities of the OCR machine. A digital text containing OCR mistakes is known as "noisy" text. The noisier the text, the harder it is to use and search.

Here is an example of a "noisy" conversion of a digitised newspaper in Zeit.shift:

## Natural Language Processing

Data collected from citizens will help us annotate the entire newspaper corpus for linguistic traits, and train algorithms to better recognise Fraktur script and to classify types of words or expressions automatically (place names, person names, temporal expressions, etc.).
