The presentation, entitled <strong>"Citizen Humanities in Tyrol: A case study on historical newspapers"</strong>, will take place on January 18th at UniversitÃ  del Salento in Lecce, Italy.


The full conference programme will be published next month. Both paper and poster will be made freely available on this website in January at the end of the conference.
