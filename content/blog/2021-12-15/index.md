We're delighted to share that we've been awarded the Eurac Research Open Research Award 2021!

The award recognises researchers at Eurac Research who most actively engage in open science, making research more collaborative and facilitating the free sharing of results. Our work stood out because of our wide adoption of open research practices --ranging from open access scientific publications to open data, tools and infrastructures-- and citizen science (including <strong>Zeit.shift</strong>!) for the preservation and dissemination of local resources and knowledge.


We're very grateful for this award and look forward to a new year of Open Science!
