We're delighted to share that our proposal to present a Zeit.shift <strong>demo</strong> at the <a href="https://conferences.au.dk/citsci2022/" target="_blank" title="Opens in new tab">Engaging Citizen Science Conference 2022</a> has been accepted!


In this demo, which will take place on April 25th in Aarhus, participants will have the chance to explore and engage with the citizen science tasks developed for the project.

The full conference programme is available at: [https://conferences.au.dk/citsci2022/programme/](https://conferences.au.dk/citsci2022/programme/)
