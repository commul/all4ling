Zeit.shift is our new **citizen science** project devoted to the **preservation, development and communication of the culture and textual heritage of Tyrol**!

Zeit.shift is a cross-border cooperation between the Dr. Friedrich TeÃŸmann Library (Bolzano, Italy), the UniversitÃ¤ts- und Landesbibliothek Tirol (Innsbruck, Austria) and Eurac Research (Bolzano, Italy) focussing on historical Tyrolean newspapers written in German and mostly Fraktur script published between 1850 and 1950.

Currently, these newspapers are scattered across Tyrol and are only partially digitised. Zeit.shift is digitising some additional 500,000 pages' worth of historical newspapers housed in the Friedrich TeÃŸmann and Innsbruck University libraries with the aim of gathering these in a single, freely accessible web platform.

To make this digitised data more searchable, usable and engaging by the general public, **we are turning to you, the citizens, for help, ideas and knowledge!** To this end, we are developing games and activities to collect data from you and to help you explore and learn from the collections in engaging and fun ways.
