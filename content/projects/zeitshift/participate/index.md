## How can I contribute?

We're developing **interactive applications** designed to help you explore this wonderful body of textual heritage as you contribute data!

**We need your help with two tasks**:
1. üìç Locate and/or tag advertisements
2. üéÆ Transcribe individual words by playing a game

**Your help will make the newspapers more usable for both humans and machines!**
- The processed text will be made available on the websites of the Friedrich Te√ümann and Innsbruck University libraries for users to search, browse and enjoy.
- The processed text will be used by Eurac Research to train algorithms to better recognise Fraktur script and classify words (place names, person names, temporal expressions, etc.).


### üìç Historypin

{{< figure src="historypin.webp" alt="Historypin" caption="Zeit.shift advertisement in Historypin." attr="This image is licensed under CC BY 3.0" attrlink="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" >}}

In this activity, citizens locate and tag historical advertisements published
in the newspapers in order to reconstruct the commercial landscape of early
20th century Tyrol. Many shops from those times still exist today!

This activity makes use of an existing third-party platform, [Historypin](https://www.historypin.org/en/).

**You will need**:

- Basic knowledge of German and Fraktur script
- A free <a href="https://www.historypin.org" target="_blank">Historypin</a> account
- A desktop computer (activity not designed for mobile devices)
- To add [specific tags]({{< relref "historypin#32-tags">}}) and/or location information to the newspaper adverts (the choice is free!)

### üéÆ √ñtzi game

{{< figure src="oetzi_game.webp" alt="Game preview" caption="√ñtzi game." attr="This image is licensed under CC BY 3.0" attrlink="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" style="margin-top: 0;" >}}

In this custom game, inspired by [Typespeed](http://typespeed.sourceforge.net/), words automatically extracted from the digitised Tyrolean newspapers drop from the sky. The goal of the game is simple: you must type the words as fast as possible before the animals reach and kill [√ñtzi the Iceman](https://www.iceman.it/en/the-iceman/)! Words typed correctly will scare off the animals and prolong √ñtzi's life. <!--When √ñtzi dies, you are shown the original newspaper article from which the killing name (the killer!) was taken, allowing you to explore its context.-->

**Requirements**:

- sufficient knowledge of German and Fraktur
