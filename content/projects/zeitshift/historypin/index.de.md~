**Diese Aktivit√§t ist f√ºr Desktop-Computer konzipiert.**

## 2. Picking the correct pins in the Collection

The search bar below the project banner allows you to search contents by tags and keywords, or to filter them by the presence of comments.

![If clicked, the "zu lokalisieren" and "zu taggen" tags allow you to display only those adverts that still need to be worked on. If clicked, these tags will automatically appear in the search bar.](search2.webp)

![If clicked, the "zu lokalisieren" tag on the left will automatically appear in the search bar on the right of the screen.](search3.webp)

To deselect the "zu lokalisieren" and "zu taggen" tags, click on the corresponding üóô icon in the search bar.

![To deselect a tag, click on the corresponding üóô icon in the search bar.](search4.png)

![To search for adverts that have comments, type "has" in the search box and click on the option provided.](search.png)

Additionally, you can use the drop-down menu next to the search bar to sort contents chronologically or alphabetically.

## 2. Contributing to the collection

To begin the activity, click on the subcollection or newspaper you wish to work on. The landing page of the subcollection looks exactly like that of the main Zeit.shift collection.
![Landing page of the **Tiroler Grenzbote** subcollection within Zeit.shift.](tigbo.webp)


Next, click on the "zu lokalisieren" and "zu taggen" tags to display adverts that need to be worked on.
![If clicked, the "zu lokalisieren" and "zu taggen" tags allow you to display only those adverts that still need to be worked on. If clicked, these tags will automatically appear in the search bar.](search2.webp)

With the "zu lokalisieren" and/or "zu taggen" tags selected, click on an advert of your choice to start working on it.


### 2.1. Suggest a better location

To suggest a better location for the advert, click on the _Suggest a better location_ link provided in the _Location_ box. Doing so will open up a window in which you will be asked to add the suggested location. You can provide rough or precise locations using the search bar and/or the map view. For added precision, you can drag-and-drop the large pink pin to your desired location. Should you wish to enlarge the map, click on the white enlarge icon in the top right corner. Click it again to return to the original size. To save your suggestion, add a comment (e.g. "Location added"), click on the _Save_ button and close the window using the pink üóô icon in the top right corner.
![Suggest a better location window. **The Comment field is mandatory!**](location.webp)

If the advert does not contain an address, add a "ohne ort" tag using the _Add a tag_ option provided in the right sidebar (see next section).


### 2.2. Tags

The _Tags_ section allows you to categorise an advert. Tags in Zeit.shift should be lowercase, can be in English, German or Italian and are very useful as they help Zeit.shift and Historypin users find specific items more easily. We ask that you add the following tags:

- "ohne ort", if the advert does not contain an address;
- "unleserlich", if the advert is not clearly legible (e.g. the ink is faded or the image is grainy);
- "duplikat", if the advert is a duplicate of another advert;
- "review", if there are other problems with the advert you wish to report (e.g. a part of it is missing);
- at least three semantic tags that best describe the advert, including person names, objects, festivities, etc. (e.g. "adolf titze", "shoes", "christmas").


To add a semantic tag, type the name in the _Tag name_ field. As you type the name, a drop-down list will appear with suggestions based on what other Historypin users have added. If your tag already exists in the list of suggestions, select it and click on the _Add a tag_ button. If your tag does not appear in the list of suggestions, click on the first entry in the list and click on the _Add a tag_ button again. New tags should appear alongside the advert's existing tags below the location map.

NB: umlauts are not rendered in Historypin, so make sure to spell out the word (e.g. NOT "m√ºhle" BUT "muehle").
![Typing and selecting a tag from the suggestions provided.](tags.webp)


### 2.3. Optional

Additionally, in the sidebar to the right of the screen, the _Share_ button provides you with options to share the advert via social media or to embed it in a website.

![Click on the **Share** button in the right sidebar to share the advert on social media or a website.](share.webp)

Below the _Share_ button, you will see the _Favourite_ ‚ô° button. This button allows you to mark the advert as a favourite item. When you favourite an item, the ‚ô° button turns orange; to unfavourite it, simply reclick on the ‚ô° button until this becomes pink again. All favourited items can be viewed in your profile under the _Favourites_ section.

![Click on the ‚ô° button in the right sidebar to save an advert to your list of favourites.](favourite.webp)

![Click on the profile button in the top right corner of the screen to access your Historypin profile and list of favourited pins.](profile.webp)

![You can view your list of favourites under your Historypin profile, in the **Favourites** section.](favourite2.webp)


Below the _Favourite_ button you will see the _Repin_ button. This button allows you to make a copy of the pin in another Historypin collection. When you click on _Repin_, you will be asked whether you want to save a copy of the pin in an existing collection to which you have contribution access or in a new collection of your own creation.

![The **Repin** button in the right sidebar allows you to add the advert to another collection to which you have access, including your own.](repin.webp)

## 4. FAQ

**Why does the number of pins on the map keep changing?**<br />
This is a known Historypin bug. Refreshing the page will restore the correct number of pins.

**My tags and comments are not being saved. What's happening?**<br />
Refresh your browser page and/or empty your browser cache to see your changes.

**Umlaut in tags**<br />
Tags in Historypin don't take the umlaut. For this reason, please type the equivalent non-diacritic character combination, e.g. _m√ºhle_ --> _muehle_.
